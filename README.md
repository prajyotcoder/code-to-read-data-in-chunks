This code fetches data from a dataset and stores it in a data table in chunks.
Fetching complex data from a database can take a significant amount of time,
and the code may sometimes crash due to network issues or other reasons. 
To mitigate this, the data is retrieved in chunks and stored in the data table
until the entire dataset is collected. This ensures that the complete data is
available for necessary actions later.

Happy coding!

(Please note that the connection string used here is based on my specific requirements.
However, others referring to this code can use their own connection string or custom 
data for testing purposes.)
